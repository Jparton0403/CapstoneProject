# Kansas City District Remapping Analysis

This repository contains the data, scripts, and Jupyter Notebooks used in the analysis of the socio-political and demographic impacts of district remapping within Kansas City, Missouri. The study examines how redistricting affects various demographic variables such as age, income, and racial composition.
