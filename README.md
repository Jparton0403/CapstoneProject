This is a data stream of census data on the district shift of 2020
###Introduction
District remapping over the entire United States has long been a tool in which a district is remapped to better help the demographics become better represented. While this can be a great tool for local municipalities to adapt to their constituencies, the long term ramifications  are often overlooked. The objective of this research is to look at how these policies, utilization of remapping and change in dynamic can affect a municipality, specifically Kansas City Missouri. By gaining insight through the use of historical maps of the six districts to the current map we will look at areas that have been remapped to other districts and how that effected the trajectory of that area
